        # We invoke pytest directly to avoid Makefile's environment assumptions if any
        # But make verify is standard, so let's try to use it if possible.
        # However, make verify expects a running service for some parts or checking health?
        # Let's look at Makefile:
        # verify target: lint, check health (expects service running!), eval_routing, pytest.
        # In CI, "service running" is hard unless we start it in background.
        
        # Strategy: Run the static/unit parts.
